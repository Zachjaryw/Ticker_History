To access Website use: https://share.streamlit.io/zachjaryw/ticker_history/main/Plot_Tickers.py

The purpose of the program is to allow for quick access to historical data from the stock market for one or multiple active stocks.
I am in the process of adding other functions to allow for the user to get access to more information and use machine learning to provide more complex information.
